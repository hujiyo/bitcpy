### bitcpy

A miniature C library for copying bits between buffers with arbitrary bit-level offsets. It provides a robust `bitcpy` function with boundary checks and a `bitcpy_fast` version for performance-critical scenarios where buffer sizes are known to be safe. This library is ideal for low-level data manipulation, such as network protocol implementation or binary data packing.
